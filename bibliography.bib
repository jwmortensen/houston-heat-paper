abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure PD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general PD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding PD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

abstract = {It is shown that in model-based geostatistics, not all parameters in theMat{\'{e}}rn class can be estimated consistently if data are observed in an increasing density in a fixed domain, regardless of the estimation methods used. Nevertheless, one quantity can be estimated consistently by the maximum likelihood method, and this quantity is more important to spatial interpolation. The results are established by using the proper- ties of equivalence and orthogonality of probability measures. Some sufficient conditions are provided for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian equivalent measures, and necessary conditions are provided for Gaussian equivalent measures. Two simulation studies are presented that show that the fixed-domain asymptotic properties can explain some finite-sample behavior of both interpolation and estimation when the sample size is moderately large.},

abstract = {Explaining the distribution of a species using local environmental features is a long stand- ing ecological problem. Often, available data is collected as a set of presence locations only thus precluding the possibility of a desired presence-absence analysis.We propose that it is natural to view presence-only data as a point pattern over a region and to use local environmental features to explain the intensity driving this point pattern. We use a hierarchical model to treat the presence data as a realization of a spatial point process, whose intensity is governed by the set of environmental covari- ates. Spatial dependence in the intensity levels is modeled with random effects involving a zero mean Gaussian process. We augment the model to capture highly variable and typically sparse sampling effort as well as land transformation, both of which degrade the point pattern. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) in South Africa provides an extensive class of such species data. The potential (i.e., nondegraded) presence surfaces over the entire area are of interest from a conservation and policy perspective. The region is divided into 37, 000 grid cells. To work with a Gaussian process over a very large number of cells we use predictive spatial process ap- proximation. Bias correction by adding a heteroscedastic error component has also been implemented. We illustrate with modeling for six of different species. Also, comparison is made with the now popu- lar Maxent approach though the latter is limited with regard to inference. The resultant patterns are important on their own but also enable a comparative view, for example, to investigate whether a pair of species are potentially competing in the same area. An additional feature of our modeling is the opportunity to infer about biodiversity through species richness, i.e., the number of distinct species in an areal unit. such investigation immediately follows within our modeling framework.},

abstract = {Colon and rectum cancer share many risk factors, and are often tabulated together as ``colorectal cancer'' in published summaries. However, recent work indicating that exercise, diet, and family history may have differential impacts on the two cancers encourages analyzing them separately, so that corresponding public health interventions can be more efficiently targeted. We analyze colon and rectum cancer data from the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System from 1998--2002 over the 16-county Twin Cities (Minneapolis--St. Paul) metro and exurban area. The data consist of two marked point patterns, meaning that any statistical model must account for randomness in the observed locations, and expected positive association between the two cancer patterns. Our model extends marked spatial point pattern analysis in the context of a log Gaussian Cox process to accommodate spatially referenced covariates (local poverty rate and location within the metro area), individual-level risk factors (patient age and cancer stage), and related interactions. We obtain smoothed maps of marginal log-relative intensity surfaces for colon and rectum cancer, and uncover significant age and stage differences between the two groups. This encourages more aggressive colon cancer screening in the inner Twin Cities and their southern and western exurbs, where our model indicates higher colon cancer relative intensity.},

The method$\backslash$navoids reliance on observed and projected changes in extreme temperatures, and also avoids the confounding effects of long-term$\backslash$ninfluences on mortality such as changes in populations and improvements in medical services. The method relies on the existence$\backslash$nof a close correlation between high-pass filtered values of a health indicator variable and a climate variable. Where such$\backslash$na relationship exists, the method provides a simple and robust way to estimate past and future health effects of climate trends.$\backslash$nThe method is used to estimate the effects of warming of winter temperatures on mortality amongst persons aged 65 years and$\backslash$nabove, in Melbourne, Australia. The observed warming of 0.7°C over the period 1979–2001 is estimated to have caused a decline$\backslash$nin winter mortality of 4.5{\%}, slightly offsetting an observed increase in mortality due to an increasing elderly population.$\backslash$nA further 2°C warming could be expected to lead to a decline in winter mortality of 13{\%}. The method was also tested on summer$\backslash$nmortality of New York City residents aged 75 years and above. In this case a 2°C warming would lead to a 2.6{\%} increase in$\backslash$nmortality.},

abstract = {Given predictions of increased intensity and frequency of heat waves, it is important to study the effect of high temperatures on human mortality and morbidity. Many studies focus on heat wave-related mortality; however, heat-related morbidity is often overlooked. The goals of this study are to examine the historical observed relationship between temperature and morbidity (illness), and explore the extent to which observed historical relationships could be used to generate future projections of morbidity under climate change. We collected meteorological, air pollution, and hospital admissions data in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the years 1989–2005, and employed a generalized additive model (GAM) to quantify the relationship between morbidity (as measured by hospital admissions) and high temperatures with adjustment for the effects of potential confounders. We also estimated temperature threshold values for different causes of hospital admissions and then quantified the associated percent increase of admissions per degree above the threshold. Finally, the future impact of higher temperatures on admissions for the years 2059–2075 was examined. Our results show that five causes of admission (endocrine, genitourinary, renal, accidental, and self-harm) and three age groups (15–64, 75–84, >85 years) were affected by high temperatures. Future projections indicate a larger number of days above the current temperature threshold leading to an increase in admissions. Our results indicate that climate change may increase heat-related hospital admissions in the US urban mid-West and that health systems should include heat wave planning.},

abstract = {Background: Heat waves have been linked with an increase in mortality, but the associated risk has been only partly characterized. Methods: We examined this association by decomposing the risk for temperature into a “main effect” due to independent effects of daily high temperatures, and an “added” effect due to sustained duration of heat during waves, using data from 108 communities in the United States during 1987–2000. We adopted different definitions of heat-wave days on the basis of combinations of temperature thresholds and days of duration. The main effect was estimated through distributed lag nonlinear functions of temperature, which account for nonlinear delayed effects and short-time harvesting. We defined the main effect as the relative risk between the median city-specific temperature during heat-wave days and the 75th percentile of the year-round distribution. The added effect was defined first using a simple indicator, and then a function of consecutive heat-wave days. City-specific main and added effects were pooled through univariate and multivariate meta-analytic techniques. Results: The added wave effect was small (0.2{\%}–2.8{\%} excess relative risk, depending on wave definition) compared with the main effect (4.9{\%}–8.0{\%}), and was apparent only after 4 consecutive heat-wave days. Conclusions: Most of the excess risk with heat waves in the United States can be simply summarized as the independent effects of individual days’ temperatures. A smaller added effect arises in heat waves lasting more than 4 days.},

Generalized additive models and zero-inflated Poisson regressions were used to estimate the effects of daily maximum three-hour apparent temperature (AT) on dispatch frequency from May to September, with adjustment for seasonality, long-term trend, weekends, and public holidays. Linear and non-linear exposure effects were considered. Effects on days when AT first exceeded its summer median were also investigated. City-specific estimates were combined using random effects meta-analyses. Exposure-response relationship was found to be fairly linear. Significant risk increase began from 21 °C with a combined relative risk (RR) of 1.22 (95 {\%} confidence interval, 1.03-1.44), increasing to 1.49 (1.42-1.57) at peak AT. When linear exposure was assumed, combined RR was 1.43 (1.37-1.50) per degree Celsius increment. Overall association was significant the first few times when median AT was initially exceeded in a particular warm season. More than two-thirds of these initial hot days were in June, implying the harmful effect of initial warming as the season changed. Risk increase that began early at the fairly mild perceived temperature implies the need for early precaution.},

This review is an extension of the brief evidence examining this relationship provided in the IPCC’s Assessment Reports. A comprehensive and critical review of the literature is presented, which highlights avenues for further research, and the respective merits and limitations of the methods used to analyse the relationships. In contrast to previous reviews that concentrate on the epidemiological evidence, this review acknowledges the inter-disciplinary nature of the topic and examines the evidence presented in epidemiological, environmental health, and climatological journals. As such, present temperature–mortality relationships are reviewed, followed by a discussion of how these are likely to change under climate change scenarios. The importance of uncertainty, and methods to include it in future work, are also considered.},

In this letter, we explore the relationships between people and places, in the context of urban heat stress, and present a new research framework for a multi-faceted, top-down and bottom-up analysis of local-level vulnerability to extreme heat. This framework aims to better represent societal vulnerability through the integration of quantitative and qualitative data that go beyond aggregate demographic information.

Hospital data have been sorted into seven different diagnostic groups as follows: (1) respiratory, cardiovascular and chest-pain complaints; (2) digestive, genitourinary and abdominal complaints; (3) neurological and psychopathological disorders; (4) infections; (5) contusion and crushing, bone and muscle complaints; (6) skin and allergies and (7) miscellaneous complaints. In general, there is an increase of 16.7{\%} in winter while, for group 2 and group 6, there are more patients in summer, 54{\%} and 75{\%} respectively. In summer, the total number of patients for group 6 shows a significant positive correlation with temperature and dew-point temperature, and a negative correlation with the sea-level pressure for the same day. In winter, the same relationship exists, however its correlation is not as strong. The lags observed between these three variables: maximum dew-point temperature, maximum temperature, minimum air pressure and the peaks in admissions are 1, 2 and 4 days respectively. In winter, increases in temperature and dew point and decreases in pressure are followed by a peak in admissions for group 2. In winter, there are significantly more cases in group 5 on warm, dry days and on warm, wet days in the summer.},

abstract = {It has been claimed that high social capital contributes to both positive public health outcomes and to climate change adaptation. Strong social networks have been said to support individuals and collective initiatives of adaptation and enhance resilience. As a result, there is an expectation that social capital could reduce vulnerability to risks from the impacts of climate change in the health sector. This paper examines evidence on the role social networks play in individuals' responses to heat wave risk in a case study in the UK. Based on interviews with independently living elderly people and their primary social contacts in London and Norwich, we suggest that strong bonding networks could potentially exacerbate rather than reduce the vulnerability of elderly people to the effects of heat waves. Most respondents interviewed did not feel that heat waves posed a significant risk to them personally, and most said that they would be able to cope with hot weather. Bonding networks could perpetuate rather than challenge these narratives and therefore contribute to vulnerability rather than ameliorating it. These results suggest a complex rather than uniformly positive relationship between social capital, health and adaptation to climate change. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Near real-time Emergency Department (ED) and ambulance surveillance allowed rapid detection of an increase in the number of heat-related ED visits and ambulance calls during this period. The purpose of this study was to quantify the excess heat-related and all-cause ED visits and ambulance calls, and excess all-cause mortality, associated with the heat wave.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: ED and ambulance data were obtained from surveillance and administrative databases, while mortality data were obtained from the state death registry. The observed counts were compared with the average counts from the same period from 2006/07 through 2009/10, and a Poisson regression model was constructed to calculate the number of excess ED visits, ambulance and deaths after adjusting for calendar and lag effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the heat wave there were 104 and 236 ED visits for heat effects and dehydration respectively, and 116 ambulance calls for heat exposure. From the regression model, all-cause ED visits increased by 2{\%} (95{\%} CI 1.01-1.03), all-cause ambulance calls increased by 14{\%} (95{\%} CI 1.11-1.16), and all-cause mortality increased by 13{\%} (95{\%} CI 1.06-1.22). Those aged 75 years and older had the highest excess rates of all outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The 2011 heat wave resulted in an increase in the number of ED visits and ambulance calls, especially in older persons, as well as an increase in all-cause mortality.

To date the focus of this association has been on communicable diseases and injuries. This paper briefly analyzes potential impacts of global climate change on chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). METHOD: We reviewed the limited available evidence of the relationships between climate exposure and chronic and NCDs. We further reviewed likely mechanisms and pathways for climatic influences on chronic disease occurrence and impacts on pre-existing chronic diseases. RESULTS: There are negative impacts of climatic factors and climate change on some physiological functions and on cardio-vascular and kidney diseases. Chronic disease risks are likely to increase with climate change and related increase in air pollution, malnutrition, and extreme weather events. CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial research gaps in this arena. The health sector has a major role in facilitating further research and monitoring the health impacts of global climate change. Such work will also contribute to global efforts for the prevention and control of chronic NCDs in our ageing and urbanizing global population.},

Percentage change in mortality was calculated at 29 degrees C apparent temperature (lag 0) and at -5 degrees C (mean of lags 1, 2, and 3) relative to 15 degrees C. Separate models were fit to death counts stratified by age, race, gender, education, and place of death. Effect estimates were combined across cities, treating city as a random effect. Deaths among Blacks compared with Whites, deaths among the less educated, and deaths outside a hospital were more strongly associated with hot and cold temperatures, but gender made no difference. Stronger cold associations were found for those less than age 65 years, but heat effects did not vary by age. The strongest effect modifier was place of death for heat, with out-of-hospital effects more than five times greater than in-hospital deaths, supporting the biologic plausibility of the associations. Place of death, race, and educational attainment indicate vulnerability to temperature-related mortality, reflecting inequities in health impacts related to climate change.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies have linked weather to mortality; however, role of such critical factors as regional variation, susceptible populations, and acclimatization remain unresolved. METHODS: We applied time-series models to 107 US communities allowing a nonlinear relationship between temperature and mortality by using a 14-year dataset. Second-stage analysis was used to relate cold, heat, and heat wave effect estimates to community-specific variables. We considered exposure timeframe, susceptibility, age, cause of death, and confounding from pollutants. Heat waves were modeled with varying intensity and duration. RESULTS: Heat-related mortality was most associated with a shorter lag (average of same day and previous day), with an overall increase of 3.0{\%} (95{\%} posterior interval: 2.4{\%}-3.6{\%}) in mortality risk comparing the 99th and 90th percentile temperatures for the community. Cold-related mortality was most associated with a longer lag (average of current day up to 25 days previous), with a 4.2{\%} (3.2{\%}-5.3{\%}) increase in risk comparing the first and 10th percentile temperatures for the community. Mortality risk increased with the intensity or duration of heat waves. Spatial heterogeneity in effects indicates that weather-mortality relationships from 1 community may not be applicable in another. Larger spatial heterogeneity for absolute temperature estimates (comparing risk at specific temperatures) than for relative temperature estimates (comparing risk at community-specific temperature percentiles) provides evidence for acclimatization. We identified susceptibility based on age, socioeconomic conditions, urbanicity, and central air conditioning. CONCLUSIONS: Acclimatization, individual susceptibility, and community characteristics all affect heat-related effects on mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mortality increases with hot weather, although the extent to which lives are shortened is rarely quantified. We compare the extent to which short-term mortality displacement can explain heat deaths in Delhi, S{\~{a}}o Paulo, and London given contrasting demographic and health profiles. METHODS: We examined time-series of daily mortality data in relation to daily ambient temperature using Poisson models and adjusting for season, relative humidity, rainfall, particulate air pollution, day of the week, and public holidays. We used unconstrained distributed lag models to identify the extent to which heat-related excesses were followed by deficits (mortality displacement). RESULTS: For each city, an increase in all-cause mortality was observed with same-day (lag 0) and previous day (lag 1) temperatures greater than a threshold of 20 degrees C. At lag 0, the excess risk was greatest in Delhi and smallest in London. In Delhi, an excess was apparent up to 3 weeks after exposure, after which a deficit was observed that offset just part of the overall excess. In London, the heat excess persisted only 2 days and was followed by deficits, such that the sum of effects was 0 by day 11. The pattern in S{\~{a}}o Paulo was intermediate between these. The risk summed over the course of 28 days was 2.4{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.1 to 4.7{\%}) per degree greater than the heat threshold in Delhi, 0.8{\%} (-0.4 to 2.1{\%}) in S{\~{a}}o Paulo and -1.6{\%} (-3.4 to 0.3{\%}) in London.

In this article, a flexible class of distributed lag models are used to analyze the effects of heat on mortality in four major metropolitan areas in the U.S. (Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York). Specifically, the proposed methodology uses Gaussian processes as a prior model for the distributed lag function. Gaussian processes are adequately flexible to capture a wide variety of distributed lag functions while ensuring smoothness properties of process realizations. Additionally, the proposed framework allows for probabilistic inference of the maximum lag. Applying the proposed methodology revealed that mortality displacement (or, harvesting) was present for most age groups and cities analyzed suggesting that heat advanced death in some individuals. Additionally, the estimated shape of the DL functions gave evidence that prolonged heat exposure and highly variable temperatures pose a threat to public health.},

abstract = {Distributed lag (DL) models relate lagged covariates to a response and are a popular statistical model used in a wide variety of disciplines to analyze exposure-response data. However, classical DL models do not account for possible interactions between lagged predictors. In the presence of interactions between lagged covariates, the total effect of a change on the response is not merely a sum of lagged effects as is typically assumed. This article proposes a new class of models, called high-degree DL models, that extend basic DL models to incorporate hypothesized interactions between lagged predictors. The modeling strategy utilizes Gaussian processes to counterbalance predictor collinearity and as a dimension reduction tool. To choose the degree and maximum lags used within the models, a computationally manageable model comparison method is proposed based on maximum a posteriori estimators. The models and methods are illustrated via simulation and application to investigating the effect of heat exposure on mortality in Los Angeles and New York.},

@book{Bivand2013,
abstract = {Average Customer Rating: 5.0 Rating: 4 Overall good, but could be less technical I was really excited when I ordered this book as it looked like the type of material I had been looking for for ages, but as it turns out I am mildly disappointed in it, primarily because I found the text somewhat hard to grasp and the code not particularly well explained. It is still a very good read though and certainly helped me enhance my knowledge of statistical analyses in R. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to examine spatial data in R, but there is a bit of homework to do to be able to understand how all the pieces fit together. Rating: 5 Just what is needed This book fills a gap in the Spatial Statistics literature. Most of the treatises are heavy on the math, and I find it difficult to bridge the gap between the formulas and applying them. The modules for R take care of this for you and leave you to interpret the result. This book covers most of these modules and demonstrates how to use them. Really worth getting. There is also the ESRI Guide to GIS Analysis Vol 2, but it is more of an introductory text. Rating: 5 Excelent Book! Do you know that felling you may have when you found exactly what you were looking for? Well, that was the felling I had when started to read this book. It brings detailed information about how you can and should use the spatial data analysis resources of R, with interactive examples and enlighten explanations. You will really understand what you are doing and will find ways to represent it the best way you could. Rating: 5 Lots of information, clearly presented. This is not a book for a beginner, but is an excellent book for two groups of readers: those who have some background with R and wish to learn about its capabilities for spatial statistics; and those with some background in spatial statistics who wish to learn how to use R. The authors have been the main developers of the spatial statistics packages on R, and therefore know the packages intimately. But the authors also have a deep knowledge of the spatial statistics literature, and I found myself learning something new about these methods in every chapter. Everyone serious about spatial statistics should see what R has to offer. This book is the easiest way to do that. Rating: 5 The best practial introduction to R spatial The R spatial packages are the leading edge for spatial analysis and spatial statistics. This book, by the primary developers of the R Spatial packages, is the best introduction to the subject that I have seen. Now, if you are comfortable with it, you can dive an and download R and R spatial and go to town. But if you need some help, this is a good place to start. This would also make a good textbook for a class on spatial analysis.},
